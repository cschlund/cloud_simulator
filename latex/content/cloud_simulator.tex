The simplified simulator calculates global monthly means of Cloud\_cci-like (i.e.
pseudo-satellite) parameters based on reanalysis data.
In the case of evaluating ERA-Interim cloud parameters, it works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]


 \item\label{it:readdata} 
The simulator starts with reading 6-hourly (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC)
three-dimensional analysis fields of the
\begin{itemize}
	\item pressure level $P_{lev}$,
	\item liquid water content $LWC$,
	\item ice water content $IWC$,
	\item cloud cover $CC$,
	\item geopotential height $h_{geo}$, and
	\item temperature $T$,
\end{itemize}
along with longitude $x$, latitude $y$, and pressure level $z$ information. 
A detailed description of the ERA-Interim data is given
in section~\ref{sec:era}.
The following steps address the things needed to ``simulate'' the observational process.
In other words, \textbf{what would a satellite see if the atmosphere had the clouds
of a climate model}?


%  \item\label{it:cwc_inc} In the next step a cloud-cover-weighted cloud water content
% at each pressure level, $z$, is computed in the case of cloud occurrence
% (i.e. $CC > 0$):
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:incloud-cwc}
%    CWC^{inc}(x,y,z) = \frac{CWC(x,y,z)}{CC(x,y,z)}
% \end{equation}
% with $inc$ denoting ``in-cloud'' and $CWC$ is either $LWC$ or $IWC$ providing
% $LWC^{inc}$ or $IWC^{inc}$, respectively.


 \item\label{it:cwp_lay} 
First of all, the \textbf{cloud water path for each layer} has to be calculated
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cwp_lay}
  CWP_{lay}(x,y,z') = CWC_{lay}(x,y,z') \cdotp \frac{\Delta P_{lev}(x,y,z')}{9.81}
\end{equation}
with $z'$ denoting the layer level ($z' = n_{z} - 1$; $n_{z}$ number of pressure levels),
$\Delta P_{lev}$ being the pressure difference between two pressure levels, and
the cloud water content per layer
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cwc_lay}
  CWC_{lay}(x,y,z') = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n CWC(x,y,z_{i})\\[1.5ex]
\end{equation}
Depending on the thermodynamic phase, $CWC$ is either $LWC$ or $IWC$.
Since a layer is defined as the region between two pressure levels, $n$ is equal 2.
Thus, Eq.~\ref{eq:cwp_lay} provides the cloud liquid and ice water path for each
layer, respectively.


  \item\label{it:cot_inc_lay} 
The next step aims at the computation of the
\textbf{in-cloud cloud optical thickness per layer}.
The word ``in-cloud'' refers to the part of the model grid cell, which is covered by clouds. 
Therefore, a cloud-cover-weighted cloud water content at each pressure level is required
\begin{equation}\label{eq:incloud-cwc}
   CWC^{inc}(x,y,z) = \frac{CWC(x,y,z)}{CC(x,y,z)}
\end{equation}
because it is used to derive the in-cloud cloud water content per layer
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cwc_inc_lay}
  CWC^{inc}_{lay}(x,y,z') = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n CWC^{inc}(x,y,z_{i})
\end{equation}
which in turn is used to calculate the in-cloud cloud water path for each layer
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cwp_inc_lay}
  CWP^{inc}_{lay}(x,y,z') = CWC^{inc}_{lay}(x,y,z') \cdotp \frac{\Delta P_{lev}(x,y,z')}{9.81}
\end{equation}
Eq.~\ref{eq:cwp_inc_lay} is then applied to derive the 
in-cloud cloud optical thickness per layer, which is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cot_inc_lay}
  \tau^{inc}_{lay}(x,y,z') = \frac{3}{4} \frac{CWP^{inc}_{lay}(x,y,z') \cdotp Q_{ext}}{r_{eff} \cdotp \rho}
\end{equation}
following the same approach as used in CC4CL \cite{Han94}.
Depending on the phase $CWP^{inc}_{lay}$ indicates either $LWP^{inc}_{lay}$ or
$IWP^{inc}_{lay}$. $Q_{ext}$ denotes the extinction coefficient, which is assumed to be 2
for water and 2.1 for ice. 
\color{red}The cloud effective radius $r_{eff}$ is assumed to be 12 $\mu$m
for water and 30 $\mu$m for ice, which are the a priori values used in CC4CL. \color{black}
The density $\rho$ is 1 g m$^{-3}$ for water and 0.9167 g m$^{-3}$ for ice.
Thus, Eq.~\ref{eq:cot_inc_lay} provides the in-cloud liquid and ice 
cloud optical thickness for each layer, respectively.
For the sake of convenience, $\tau^{inc}_{lay}$ will be referred to as $\tau$ from now on. 

 \item\label{it:search4cloud} 
Afterwards the simulator iteratively searches bottom-up for the uppermost cloud layer 
by means of a threshold approach applied 
to the vertically integrated total in-cloud cloud optical thickness
\begin{equation}
\tau^{total}(x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} \tau^{liq}(x,y,z_{i}) + \tau^{ice}(x,y,z_{i})
\end{equation}
where $k$ is ranging from $(n_{z}-2)$ until 1.
This means that in the first iteration $\tau^{total}$ represents 
the vertical integration between the top of the model atmosphere
and the last but two pressure level $0<i<n_{z}-2$. 
In the next iteration, $k$ ranges from $i=0$ until $i=z-3$ and so on,
until the last iteration considering the uppermost layer $0<i<1$ of the model atmosphere.
If the given threshold is exceeded, the following cloud parameters are 
aggregated on a 0.5 degree longitude-latitude grid:
\color{red}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\textbullet & Cloud top pressure & $CTP(x,y) = P_{lev}(x,y,z)$ & [hPa]\\[2.0ex]
\textbullet & Cloud top height & $CTH(x,y) = h_{geo}(x,y,z)$ & [km]\\[2.0ex]
\textbullet & Cloud top temperature & $CTT(x,y) = T(x,y,z)$ & [K] \\[2.0ex]
\textbullet & Total column liquid water path &
$LWP(x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=z_{0}}^z LWP_{lay}(x,y,i)$ & [g/m$^{2}$] \\[2.0ex]
\textbullet & Total column ice water path &
$IWP(x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=z_{0}}^z IWP_{lay}(x,y,i)$ & [g/m$^{2}$] \\[2.0ex]
\textbullet & Cloud phase &
$CPH(x,y) = \frac{LWP_{lay}(x,y,z)}{LWP_{lay}(x,y,z) +IWP_{lay}(x,y,z)}$ & [0;1]\\[2.0ex]
\textbullet & Cloud fraction & $CFR(x,y) = max[CC(x,y,z_{0}:z)]$ & [0;1] \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In order to simulate the binary cloud mask (clear, cloudy) and cloud phase (liquid, ice)
derived in the pre-processing of CC4CL (see Section~\ref{sec:cloudcci}), both the cloud
fraction and cloud phase are rounded to its closest integer (i.e. 0 or 1) for each grid
cell.\\
Then, the cloud water path is reset depending on the cloud phase of the uppermost layer,
i.e. if the cloud phase equals 0 (1), then the liquid (ice) water path is set to zero and
the ice (liquid) water path is the sum of $LWP$ and $IWP$.
This adaption is necessary because passive spaceborne instruments are not capable to
retrieve information about the different levels within a cloud as compared to model
data. Hence, the simulator has to take into account that a satellite sensor provides
the vertical integrated liquid (ice) water content of existing cloud layers based on the
thermodynamic phase of the uppermost cloud layer that could be identified by the retrieval
system.

% Finally, 4 analyses per day per month are collected (i.e. iterating (a) $\rightarrow$ (e))
% and summed up creating monthly gridded averages of original reanalysis (based on
% thv$_{ori}$) and pseudo-satellite (based on thv$_{sat}$) cloud parameters stored in a
% netCDF4 file.\\
